		<h2>Learn about Ocean Noise</h2>
		<p>Marine life exists in a world dominated by sound. From pistol shrimp to blue whales, marine species use sound to find prey and communicate.<br> But over the last 100 years or so, increasing levels of anthropogenic noise have begun to drown out the ocean's natural sound.

			<h1>Three Major Cause of Ocean Noise</h1>
			<p>The leading contributors to ocean noise come from commercial, industrial, and military sources: Shipping, Seismic, and Sonar.

 		<div id = "c1text">
 			<img src="img/boat1.png" width="40%">
			<h1>Shipping</h1>
			<p>At any given time, there are up to sixty thousand commercial ships traversing our seas worldwide. Cavitation from propellers and the rumble of engines reverberate through every corner of the ocean.<br><br>The incessant and increasing cacophony masks whale's ability to hear and be heard, hindering their ability to prosper and ultimately to survive.</p>

	<div class="cCase2">
		<div id = "c2text">
			<img src="img/boat2.png" width="60%">
			<h1>Seismic</h1>
			<p>To detect oil and gas deposits beneath the ocean floor, the petrochemical industry uses seismic airguns, the modern form of exploratory dynamite. Ships tow arrays of these guns, discharging extremely intense pulses of sound toward the sea floor.<br><br> During seismic surveys, acoustic explosions continue for days or weeks on end. The blasts disrupt critical behavior and communication among whales and can have massive impacts on fish populations.</p>

			<h1>Sonar</h1>
			<p>Sonar is the principal submarine detection system used by the U.S. Navy and other navies of the world. To detect targets, naval warships generate extremely loud waves of sound that sweep the ocean.<br><br>Military sonar acts as an enormous predator. When exposed, some whales go silent, stop foraging, and abandon their habitat. Repeated exposure can harm entire populations of animals, and has led to mass whale strandings from the Canary Islands and the Caribbean to Japan.</p>

	<div id = "demo111">
			<h1>Why They Matter</h1>
			<p>Whales are at the top of the food chain and have an important role in the overall health of the marine environment. Unfortunately their large size and thical aura does not protect them; six out of the 13 great whale species are classified as endangered, even after decades of protection.

			<p>1.Whales play an important role in stabilizing the aquatic food chain and reproduction of other species. As more whales are killed the food distribution in the ocean becomes destabilized and causes changes in the food supply of many other kinds of marine life.
			</p>
			<p>2.Scientific studies of the cetacean species (whales, dolphins and porpoises) has led to a lot of discoveries and advancements regarding echolocation, aquatic environments, marine life/biology and marine mammal intelligence and other important oceanic topics.
			</p>	
			<p>3.Whale poop plays a large role in stabilizing the offset of carbon in the atmosphere providing a healthier environment for both land and aquatic lifeforms.
